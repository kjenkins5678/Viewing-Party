## Description
In the current climate, people need a way to stay connected, and what better topic to connect over than movies! With everyone mostly stuck inside, everyone is watching more movies and tv shows and need a way to talk about and connect over them. Enter Viewing Party, the social-distancing social media site, where you can create or join a club of friends or like-minded viewers to share what you’re watching and what you think. Each user has their to-watch and watched lists and their list of clubs they are a part of and each club has its users, general comments, and comments on specific movies for all to see. Powered by the tmdb api, it’s easy for anyone to find new movies, add them to their watch list, and share them with others in their club.

## Features
​
* Users can sign up, login, and sign out with user authentication.
* Users can create and join clubs with other users.
